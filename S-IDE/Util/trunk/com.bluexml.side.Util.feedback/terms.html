<h1>SIDE Feedback Terms of Use</h1>
<p>This document describes
how BlueXML will treat the data provided by
individuals and organizations through the SIDE Feedback.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A unique id is
	generated for every workstation that submits
	data using the SIDE Feedback.  This session id is transmitted every
	time data is sent to BlueXML.</li>
	<li>BlueXML does not intend for the SIDE Feedback to collect
	information that can uniquely identify you as an individual.
	</li>
	<li>The data that is
	being collected relates to how you are using SIDE.
	This includes, but is not limited to, information on generators and deployers names,
	version numbers, options used.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uses of the Information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>BlueXML may, in its sole discretion, make available to
	organizations and individuals, on a case-by case-basis, the data
	that it collects through the SIDE Feedback, whether in raw or
	aggregated form.
	</li>
	<li>BlueXML will publish summary reports based on the data obtained.
	These reports will be made available in machine readable format that
	will allow individuals and organizations to undertake further
	analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interactions with
the SIDE Feedback</h2>

<ul>
	<li>With your
	permission, the SIDE Feedback will periodically transmit your usage
	data to the Eclipse Foundation.  The first time it attempts to
	transmit the data, you will be requested to grant permission of
	transmission.  If you decline the request, the SIDE Feedback will
	stop functioning, until you decide to re-enable it.  If you grant
	permission, you will have the option of allowing the SIDE Feedback
	to automatically transmit data without further interaction or to
	request your permission each time it attempts to transmit data.</li>
	<li> At anytime, you
	may view the data that is being collected.  To view your current
	information, go to the
	&quot;Usage Data Collection | Preview&quot; preferences page.</li>
	<li>After providing
	your initial permission, you may discontinue use of the SIDE Feedback
	by turning off the &quot;Change Upload Preference&quot;
	on the &quot;Usage Data Collection&quot; preferences page.</li>
</ul>
