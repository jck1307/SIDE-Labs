   ${symbol_pound}   NOTE
   ${symbol_pound}   ----
   ${symbol_pound}      Log4j uses the following logging levels:
   ${symbol_pound}      debug,info,warn,error,fatal
   ${symbol_pound}
   ${symbol_pound}      To set the logging level of {fullClassName} to {loglevel},
   ${symbol_pound}      add a line to this file of the following form:
   ${symbol_pound}   
   ${symbol_pound}               log4j.logger.{fullClassName}={loglevel}
   ${symbol_pound}
   ${symbol_pound}      For example, to make 'com.example.MyExample' produce 'debug'
   ${symbol_pound}      logs, add a line like this:
   ${symbol_pound}   
   ${symbol_pound}               log4j.logger.com.example.MyExample=debug
   ${symbol_pound}
   ${symbol_pound}
   ${symbol_pound}   WARNING
