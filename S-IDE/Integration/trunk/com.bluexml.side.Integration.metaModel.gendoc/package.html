The com.bluexml.side.Util.MetaModel.gendoc contains methods and mains to generate documentation about metamodels in two ways.
Fisrt, we can generate documentation about 'objects' contained in the console of S-IDE modeler (class, ...) only (this a filter on 'objects' having a metamodel to describe them).
So we work with the files called xxx.diagramconfigurator.
Then, we can generate documentation directly from the metamodel of an 'object'. This is the case for the Forms (because that part has not a xxx.diagramconfogurator).
So we generate documentation directly from the form.ecore metamodel.

To do that, the package is decomposed in three classes:
one is called ParsePalette; its goal is to select objects of the S-IDE console having a metamodel (i.e for wich we can generate documentation).
An other one is called DocMetamodel. Its goal is to check if a metamodel contains documentation; if this is the case, a xxx.docbook is generated, if not, nothing is generated.
Finally, the last one is called Main: it is in that class that the first type of generation can be done; it gets xxx.diagramconfigurator (entry in the .properties file) and genrate the associated xxx.docbook,
calling methods in ParsePalette and DocMetamodel.
It is important to note that for Forms the call of ParsePalette methods is shunted: we just call the DocMetaModel methods; to do that, a main is inclued in
DocMetamodel, getting the .ecore file (entry) and generating the documentation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the rules applied in the algorithms to generate documentation are based on rules to write that documentation in the metamodels.
