 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->

 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Definition: This is the root element which is the first created element of the form model. All forms will be child of this element. 
 * It has no corresponding elements in the Data model and is usually not generated.
 * Operations:
 * - The operation ‘Synchronize with Class Diagram’ might be called when your Data model has been changed to propagate these changes in your forms. 
 * The changes which will be propagated are: 
 *  . New attribute (in Data Diagram) are added to the form.
 *  . Deleted attribute (in Data Diagram) are removed from the form.
 *  . Attribute which have been put as mandatory (in Data Diagram) will be put in form if they have been deleted in field’s form.
 *  . If an attribute (in Data Diagram) have been changed its type (eg : String to Date) the kind of field will be changed (CharFiled to DateField).
 * All the other changes which are not propagated imply a manual update in the concerned forms.
