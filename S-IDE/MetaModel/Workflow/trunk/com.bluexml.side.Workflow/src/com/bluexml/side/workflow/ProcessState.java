 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Definition: The 'ProcessState' represents a subprocess. It may have variables. The process state is a state that is associated with another process definition. When graph execution arrives in the process state, a new process instance of the sub-process is created and it is associated with the path of execution that arrived in the process state. The path of execution of the super process will wait till the sub process instance has ended. When the sub process instance ends, the path of execution of the super process will leave the process state and continue graph execution in the super process.
