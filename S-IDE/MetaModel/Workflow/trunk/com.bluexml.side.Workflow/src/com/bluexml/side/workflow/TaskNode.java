 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Definition: A 'TaskNode' is a task that must be performed by a 'Swimlane'. 'TaskNode' can have one or more 'Attribute'. A task node represents one task that is to be performed by humans. So when execution arrives in a task node, task instances will be created in the task lists of the workflow participants. After that, the node will behave as a wait state. So when the users perform their task, the task completion will trigger the resuming of the execution. In other words, that leads to a new signal being called on the token.
