/**
 * @class Ext.util.DelayedTask
 * <p> The DelayedTask class provides a convenient way to "buffer" the execution of a method,
 * performing setTimeout where a new timeout cancels the old timeout. When called, the
 * task will wait the specified time period before executing. If durng that time period,
 * the task is called again, the original call will be cancelled. This continues so that
 * the function is only called a single time for each iteration.</p>
 * <p>This method is especially useful for things like detecting whether a user has finished
 * typing in a text field. An example would be performing validation on a keypress. You can
 * use this class to buffer the keypress events for a certain number of milliseconds, and
 * perform only if they stop for that amount of time.  Usage:</p><pre><code>
var task = new Ext.util.DelayedTask(function(){
    alert(Ext.getDom('myInputField').value.length);
});
// Wait 500ms before calling our function. If the user presses another key 
// during that 500ms, it will be cancelled and we'll wait another 500ms.
Ext.get('myInputField').on('keypress', function(){
    task.{@link #delay}(500); 
});
 * </code></pre> 
 * <p>Note that we are using a DelayedTask here to illustrate a point. The configuration
 * option <tt>buffer</tt> for {@link Ext.util.Observable#addListener addListener/on} will
 * also setup a delayed task for you to buffer events.</p> 
 * @constructor The parameters to this constructor serve as defaults and are not required.
 * @param {Function} fn (optional) The default function to call.
 * @param {Object} scope The default scope (The <code><b>this</b></code> reference) in which the
 * function is called. If not specified, <code>this</code> will refer to the browser window.
 * @param {Array} args (optional) The default Array of arguments.
